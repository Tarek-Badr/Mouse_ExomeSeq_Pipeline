# **Refrences preparation**

The pipeline requires various refrences and resources to run properly.

## **Mouse Refrence Genome**

The mouse reference genome mm10/GRCm38 can be downloaded from 
[here](https://emea.support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html?langsel=/de/) 
or 
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/mouse)
For the pipeline I use the latest GRCm38.p6 (patch 6) avialable at that point
